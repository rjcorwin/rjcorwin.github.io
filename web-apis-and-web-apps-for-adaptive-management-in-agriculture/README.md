# Web APIs and Web Apps for Adaptive Management in Agriculture! (DRAFT)

> Definition of Web API ~ A standard way that any Web App can access data from another Web App.

## The problem
Researchers develop indicators to help farmers steer their farms better... but there is a problem. These indicators are often only calculated once in a season and often locked up in spreadsheets that require a specialist to use. Farmers want to be agile! They call it adaptive management. To become more adaptive, farmers have adopted tools that generate tons of data through environmental monitoring technology and online farm management software.  But there’s a problem, all of this data is stuck in silos. 

So here’s the situation. Researchers develop tools to calculate indicators that farmers can’t use and tools that help farmers generate data don’t make it easy to move that data so that it could be used in the researchers’ tools. 

## Our proposal
Web APIs to the rescue! If more services that help generate data for farmers published Web APIs and more researchers built their models as Web Apps that use these Web APIs, farmers could see those indicators calculated countless times in a season in real time!

We will pursue both ends:
- Help facilitate the creation of Web APIs for Web Apps that generate farmer data.
- Help researchers build Web Apps that utilize these APIs.  Possibility for an Open Source platform for researchers to easily access Web APIs related to Agriculture so they can start building their tools quickly as Web Apps quickly based on live data sources.

We are going to get more farming data more often available over Web APIs so researchers can build Web Apps that give feedback with shorter feedback loops to farmers. This enables adaptive management.

## Examples of Web APIs for Agriculture in development
- [Hive](http://wiki.apitronics.com/doku.php) - Publishes a Web API for environmental data on a farm being automatically tracked.
- [Drupal Farm](http://farmhack.net/tools/drupal-farm) - Working on publishing a Web API for farm management data that is being entered by the farmer as they manage their farm.


# The question for farmers
With those data sources available in realtime and combineable in another Web App, what indicators would you like to see calculated? Who would you share those indicators with?

Note:
Data portability is about standardizing the data format which is the container, a Web API is a bridge to carry that container across.
