mission: resilient agriculture is agriculture based on local and regional food systems

more people means = more farms = more negative externalities = destruction of ecological services = higher cost of water and food = starvation

cheap fuel gives us cheap transportation and cheap nitrogen.

> The majority of the nitrogen in your body probably came from the Haber-Bosch process. And without it, more than half of the world's population would have nothing to eat.

But this process destroys our clean water, [something we may be fighting wars over in the future](http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/blue-gold-coming-water-wars).

The current system is dependent on cheap fossil fuels for transporting them so far. The price of oil goes up, the price of food goes up. We are at peak oil thus the price of oil and food may soon  sky rocket.

i dream of worlds touching each other in blankets of air

... less interdependence on energy and food is a more peaceful world.

# healthy democracies for world peace

reduce interdependence of nations

Imagine a world where every country, every state, was self sufficient. All the things you could ever want, food, shelter, material goods are made less than 100 miles from where you live. War drifts into the past as each group of people realize they have nothing to fight over. To invade another country brings no material gain or economic advantage.

all nations commit to a contitution following a few common items: 

- a couple of basic clauses in their constitutions involving human rights 
- fight those who seek to grow beyond their means
- all nations commit to cease trade


Did you know that our planet is running out of oil and that in the next few decades we'll see the price of oil rise dramatically 

50 years from now I'll be looking into my children's eyes and they will know I did damn near everything I could to save them from the catastrophies we know damn well that we are handing down to them.
