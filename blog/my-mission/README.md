mission: resilient agriculture is agriculture based on local and regional food systems

```
Hey RJ,

Great speaking last week. Still recovering from an all weekend hackathon at Khan Academy, tired, but I enjoyed myself and got to dive into Backbone.js for the first time which was a good experience overall. 

I did some thinking after our conversation and have come up with an early version of a problem statement I wanted to share with you to see what you think:

"Commercial agriculture has devolved into an industry with a focus on short-term gains, rather than long-term sustainability. Fruits and vegetables are grown for their shelf-life and size, rather than for taste and nutrient density. The price of these foods has become dependent on the price of oil, and the availability of water, while water savings from new farming techniques have plateaued. The average age of a farmer in the USA is 58, and just 5,000 farmers provide food for over 50% of the US population. The industry has become centralized, resource-inefficient, and dangerously focused on optimization over quality. 

Although the problem is complex, if well-established water-saving farming techniques such as hydroponics and aquaponics can be combined with innovative business models to become fiscally competitive with current commercial scale production, the power of food production could be transferred from the corporation to the community in the form of organic urban farms." 

Believe it or not I slimmed that down from quite a bit more... there's a lot to be said in the problem section and a lot I left out of the solution section, but interested to see what your thoughts are on this first pass -- let me know! One thing that might be a good iteration is more clearly defining the goal, e.g. "Design a cash-flow positive, community-centered, resource efficient, organic farming business model." 

One last thing: have you heard of http://brightagrotech.com/? They seem to be doing some really awesome stuff, I'm going to try and get in touch unless you already know them. 

Talk soon,
Dylan

- farms who deliver food to their local community are less likely to pass negative externalities onto that community because of the risk of losing their customers.



more people means = more farms = more negative externalities = destruction of ecological services = higher cost of water and food = starvation

cheap fuel gives us cheap transportation and cheap nitrogen.

> The majority of the nitrogen in your body probably came from the Haber-Bosch process. And without it, more than half of the world's population would have nothing to eat.

But this process destroys our clean water, [something we may be fighting wars over in the future](http://www.worldaffairsjournal.org/article/blue-gold-coming-water-wars).

The current system is dependent on cheap fossil fuels for transporting them so far. The price of oil goes up, the price of food goes up. We are at peak oil thus the price of oil and food may soon  sky rocket.

i dream of worlds touching each other in blankets of air

... less interdependence on energy and food is a more peaceful world.

# healthy democracies for world peace

reduce interdependence of nations

Imagine a world where every country, every state, was self sufficient. All the things you could ever want, food, shelter, material goods are made less than 100 miles from where you live. War drifts into the past as each group of people realize they have nothing to fight over. To invade another country brings no material gain or economic advantage.

all nations commit to a contitution following a few common items: 

- a couple of basic clauses in their constitutions involving human rights 
- fight those who seek to grow beyond their means
- all nations commit to cease trade


Did you know that our planet is running out of oil and that in the next few decades we'll see the price of oil rise dramatically 

50 years from now I'll be looking into my children's eyes and they will know I did damn near everything I could to save them from the catastrophies we know damn well that we are handing down to them.
