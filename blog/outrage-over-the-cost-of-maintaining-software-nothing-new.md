At a recent ... The answer that [some folks have](http://digitalimpactalliance.org/2732-2/)
 respond with is the ["Principles for Digital Development"](http://digitalprinciples.org/). 

The problem with those principles is, they are impossible.



> -Principle 3: Design for Scale
> -Principle 4: Build for Sustainability




- We don't build the first time for scale, we build to design with the user. 
- We do not build for sustainability, we plan for sustainability.

How do we work with the fact that we have to lie to ourselves in order to even do these projects?

We also cannot build "build for sustainability" because no software will ever be perfect and free itself of maintenance cost.

> To keep teams from constantly plugging leaks while missing the reason the boat is sinking, we need to apply the principles of agile development and user centered design to how we work on software after the initial release. Instead of a small team working constantly to fix small bugs, an entire team should work in bursts of activity. A team might work on a few software projects focusing on a different project each quarter, depending on the data.

The answer is then to stop lying to ourselves and set expectations. Fred Brookes told us we have to write it twice, this is how we scale. And just like your roads, we must maintain it to sustain it.
