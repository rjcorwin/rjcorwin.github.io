description: farmOS is a web-based application for farm management and planning. It is built on Drupal, which makes it modular, extensible, and secure. Both Drupal and farmOS are licensed under the GNU General Public License, which means they are open source. You can host it yourself on your own web server, or you can use Farmier, a farmOS hosting service.
