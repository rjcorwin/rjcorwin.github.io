                    <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left;">Most of our world's energy comes from one place, the sun. Farms are society's most important way of translating sunlight into productive capacity. Fossil fuels are a battery of sunlight that's running out, farms are our future.</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Smaller more distributed farms empower communities </h4>
                    <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left;">A community that can feed its members is a community that controls its own destiny. Without dependence on centralized agriculture, issues of fluctuating food prices and supply are less of an issue. And local food tastes better too!</p>

                    <h4 class="service-heading">Healthy farms make for a healthy environment</h4>
                    <p class="text-muted" style="text-align: left;">Farms are a major source of water and chemical polution. Farms that are better managed avoid over application of fertilizers and pesticides that would otherwise end up in our water supply.</p>
